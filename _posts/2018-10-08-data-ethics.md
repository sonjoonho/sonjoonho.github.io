Today we returned from the Amsterdam Privacy Conference 2018 as winners of the Data Ethics Case Competition sponsored by Palantir!

Our team consisted of Kelvin Zhang (Imperial College Computing), Wafia Zia (University College London English), Maddy Richer (University of Cambridge Natural Sciences) and myself. We were tasked with writing an Executive Summary of a proposal to create and manage a modern, large-scale data collection programme in a way which is ethical. We were required to consider both ethical and technical aspects, which meant that our team had to be diverse in background.

Then, we were invited to present our solution to a panel of distinguished judges at the Amsterdam Privacy Conference 2018 as finalists. After some gruelling questions, we were selected as the overall winnders of the competition!

If you're interested, I've embedded our Executive Summary below.
