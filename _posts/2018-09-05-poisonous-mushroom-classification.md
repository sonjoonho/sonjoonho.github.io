This is a study on the UCI Mushroom dataset. 

The aim of the notebook is to explore the associations between variables in the data, and then create and test a basic classifier based on what we have learned from this exploratory data analysis.

The notebook includes meta information about the dataset, prerequisite domain knowledge, and the following data analysis and models.
