Mobilise was initially developed over 4 weeks for the 2nd Year WebApps group project at Imperial College London. For this project, we were awarded the 1st place [WebApps project prize](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/course-admin/noticeboards/second-year/labs/webapps/).

## The Problem

Every month, in London, 13 million meals are wasted, and yet 9 million meals are needed to feed the hungry. Now, if we’re being honest, we don’t have the answer to this problem - but we do care about it.
We initially thought about developing an app connecting the hungry to organisations with excess food, but we found that there were already charities out there doing just that. We reached out to them, asking them about the problems they faced. 

[City Harvest](http://www.cityharvest.org.uk/) responded. City Harvest is a small but impressive operation, focused on rescuing meals for the hungry. Through the work of passionate and dedicated individuals they have rescued over 5 million meals to date.
 
But it isn't easy - two-thirds of people that signed up in May never even arranged their first shift. Furthermore, 40% of active volunteers decide not to go through this process and decide instead to just turn up. This leads to situations where City Harvest has to turn away volunteers one day since they have too many, yet they are short of volunteers on the next! It shouldn't be this way.

## Mobilise

This is the question that has driven our project, Mobilise. Mobilise is a smart volunteer coordination application, designed and developed in cooperation with staff and volunteers from City Harvest. Week after week we visited City Harvest to learn the fine details of the problems that both volunteers and coordinators face on a day to day basis. We believe that Mobilise will both simplify and improve the complicated aspects of volunteering and volunteer coordination. 

Mobilise makes it easy to create, book, and edit shifts.

The **Ping** functionality allows volunteer coordinators to contact volunteers in the event that more volunteers are needed on short notice.

Shifts that are predicted to be understaffed by our system are recommended to volunteers.

## Future

Many WebApps projects come to an end with the end of the WebApps project. However, Mobilise has a bright future. We are the first group of students to have the backing of Imperial Charity Insights, who have sponsored us to develop this project further over the summer.

Our primary focus will be on improving the functionality of current features, and creating a more stable, robust platform.

We also plan on moving the recommender system out into its own service, to facilitate things like A/B testing.
