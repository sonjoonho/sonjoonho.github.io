# Plugin 1 - Counting Methodology

Images can be found at on the [box](https://imperialcollegelondon.app.box.com/folder/111436225059) under `2. Quality Control - Images Input`.  Data collected should be uploaded to `3. Quality Control - Output Raw Data`. Folders already exist for each members. For plugin 1 we will be counting RBPMS labelled images, split into "Injured" (`{1-6}.tif`) and "Uninjured" (`{A-F}.tif`). Please look at the example videos for guidance on what to count as a cell.

| Name             | Number |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Tiger Cross      | (1)    |
| Arjun Singh      | (2)    |
| Joon-Ho Son      | (3)    |
| Miruna Rusu      | (4)    |
| Rasika Navarange | (5)    |
| William Burr     | (6)    |

1. Start a timer.
2. Use the **multi-point** tool to count each cell as shown in the video. Then note the total count shown in the left-hand columns under `Analyze > Measure`. 
3. Stop the timer when you are finished.
4. Save the counted image in a separate folder (make sure you don't confuse the original and counted images!) and upload it to your folder on box. The counted images should retain the points selected when re-opened in ImageJ.
5. Note your time and count, and fill in the appropriate cells in the spreadsheet.
